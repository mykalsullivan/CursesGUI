Stuff to do
* Add unimplemented elements
* Command-line module (shared library) that can be loaded
* Introduce multithreading support (at some point)
    - Render and input threads
    - The master panel should be a thread, then all direct subpanels should be their own thread
        - All panels below each subpanel are part of the same thread
* Fix wonky rendering

Bugs
* Moving panels will not move elements inside panels
* Extending panels won't check bounds properly
* I have no idea how to control the framerate
