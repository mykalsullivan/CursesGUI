# CursesGUI
A Curses-based GUI library that aims to take the struggle out of making Curses-based programs

## Inspiration
I mainly wanted to separate the graphics rendering from a Curses game I was working on, but it turned out to become a lot larger than I anticipated initially.
... I'll add more background information soon.

## Dependencies
* EnTT (entity-component-system) https://github.com/skypjack/entt
* Ncurses (terminal graphics) https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/

## Compiling
To compile:
  1. Unzip source archive (.zip)
  2. Move into source directory
  3. Build makefile using `cmake -B .`
  4. Compile with `make`

## Plans
So far, I'm mainly concerned with getting simple graphics rendering working.
I'll elaborate further later.
