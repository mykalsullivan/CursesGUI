* You might want to fix the CList
	- Objects cannot be removed
	- The 'clear' function does not delete objects from the list
* When a QWidget is destroyed, the children are not properly deleted along with it
* Widgets need a way to remove itself from it's parent if it is the child of a parent widget.
	- Example:
		CWidget* widget1 = new CWidget; 	<-- Widget 1
		CWidget* widget2 = new CWidget;		<-- Widget 2
		widget1->addWidget(widget2);		<-- Widget 2 is now the child of widget 1
		
		delete widget2;				<-- Widget 2 has been deleted, but a pointer to it still exists in widget 1
