1. Most of the stuff in the CursesGUI directory
    1. Add function declarations based on Qt classes of the same name
    2. Add enum types based on the ones from Qt
2. Basic rendering
3. Move CursesWindow to CWindow or CScreen class (whichever one makes the most sense)
4. Find out how to handle top-level CWidgets


### Features to REMOVE: ###
1. EnTT implementation
    * For something like this, it makes it easier and simpler just to use standard OOP instead of an ECS
